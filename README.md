# Data Visualization

This is a simple NodeJS / Express application using ChartJS to display data in both a pie chart and a bar chart. 

To use this application, just simply do `npm install` then you can use `npm start` to fire up the application. 

On `localhost:3000` you should be able to find the home page of the application and navigate to both styles of charts.
